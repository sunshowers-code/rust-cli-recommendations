# Key words

The key words *must*, *must not*, *required*, *should*, *should not*,
*recommended*, *may*, and *optional*, derive their meanings from
[RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119), but have
somewhat different connotations because this is a list of recommendations
and not a standard.

* *must*, *must not* and *required* mean that an application that doesn't follow this recommendation is *incorrect* and has a bug that needs to be fixed.
* *should*, *should not* and *recommended* mean that most applications should follow this recommendation, but there are valid reasons not to.
* *may* and *optional* mean that programs are free to follow this recommendation or ignore it; there are valid reasons in either direction.
